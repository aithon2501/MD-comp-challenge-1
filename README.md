There has been a long-standing "joke" between my youngest son and I about starting a food truck. We've made menues, visited other food trucks to see how they work, and even looked up how much our own truck would cost. It's our favorite shared dream/pet project. So, in that tradition, I have created a site that reflects how the website for our food truck might look. 

The icons all came from the Noun Project on the suggestion of fellow student, but they all came with additional text regarding who made the icon based on the creative commons license they were uploaded under. This text is not mine.
